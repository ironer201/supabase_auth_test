# supabase_auth_test

This is a testing project. In here I test the authentication and profile managing using supabase database, an online database. To connect the Supabase with the JavaScript file is very simple. It just use API key known as aeon key and Supabase URL. by using this two thing I easily connect the JavaScript file with Supabase database. However in the Github repository anyone can access the code and by using JavaScript anyone can fetch the database from Supabase so I set a rule in the database so that other user expect me can't access other information. 
In the authentication valid Email is very important and some time it is hard for new developer to verify valid Email. Supabase has a built-in Email verification system that can identify valid email. For experiment purpose I disabled it. Hosting project is very important for developer but some time because of database hosting project is diffcult but using supabase we can do it easily
This project is simple and it is meant to be learning purposed and to learn about authentication system and data fetching\n
